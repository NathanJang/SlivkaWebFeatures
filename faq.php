									What are points?

							<div class="panel-body">
								Housing points are points that determine the eligibility of a resident to return to Slivka. By the end of Winter Quarter, these points are totaled and ranked by amount. Then, starting from the top of the list, Slivkans are invited to return until all available slots have been filled. The Vice President is responsible for recording housing points and consistently reporting them to Slivkans. Discrepancies can be addressed with the Vice President to rectify any errors held valid by the Vice President.

									How do I get points?
								</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="panel-body">
								Points are awarded by participation throughout the academic year until Winter Quarter. At Slivka, we want everyone to get involved and become part of the Slivkan community. Thus, points are rewards for attending (or even hosting) various Slivkan events such as munchies, firesides, Peer-to-Professor (P2P) lunches, Student-Faculty Receptions, group bonding, house meetings, intramural sports, committees, maintenance, and much more!
